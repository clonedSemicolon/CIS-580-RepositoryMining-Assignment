VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(Movement): add ability to change play area Y on mesh colliders

It is now possible to move up and down mesh colliders by walking in
the play area and the mesh below will affect the Y of the play area.

It has an adverse effect of not doing the blink on fast movements
such as falling from a mesh because it's not an actual teleport but
a walk within game space.",39e91b82314b98f79ac2ce56f918705004279487
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(Interaction): add grab precognition for catching objects easier

If an object is falling very fast then it is difficult to press the
grab button on the controller at the right time due to human reflexes
being an issue. The Grab Precognition parameter on the Interact Grab
script allows for a small window of time from the point of the grab
button being pressed to when the object has to collide with the
controller. If the object collides within the given time frame then
the grab action is successful. This makes it easier for catching items
as they fall fast, or the ability to swipe and grab an item without
being particualrly careful with the grab motion.",d792617ebf24b740bcfe8039d9a468bee7d4dcfd
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(Controller): add ability to get controller velocity

VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(Events): add unity events helper scripts for delegate events

The toolkit uses C# delegates to raise events, however, Unity Events
provide a nice inspector interface (but come at a performance cost) so
Unity Event helper scripts have been added that can be used to extend
the relevant script that is using a C# delegate to provide the benefit
of Unity Events but optionally to remove the requirement of the
performance overhead.",b5f9b10e219d617296af53f1403a06e8e51bb042

VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(Interaction): allow interactable objects to be disabled

As the Interactable Object script executes an Update and Fixed Update
it can cause performance issues when many interactable objects are
within a scene and active. The Update and Fixed Update only need to
execute if the object is actively being interacted with so a new
option of `Disable On Idle` has been added and if it is set to `true`
then when the Interactable Object is not being interacted with then
the Interactable Object script will be disabled meaning the Update
and Fixed Update methods are not executed each frame.

It may be required to ensure the Interactable Object is always running
the Update and/or Fixed Update method so in these cases the `Disable On
Idle` method should be set to false, as demonstrated in the example
scene `006_Controller_UsingADoor`.",d2002e0eed66e5e12a5217d19bc61edb1cb4696d
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"perf(ControllerEvents): don't create garbage on vector comparison

The Touchpad Walking script now has an option to press an additional
button to activate a speed multiplier which if is set to a number
above 1f then it will speed up the movement, however if it is set
below 1f then it will slow movement down.",a57af77675291ceee5f4eaf682c70e7deabbbdc3
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"feat(ControllerReference): add new way of referencing controllers

Previously, controller calls were referenced in a number of ways from
utilising the controller's id, to passing a game object of either the
actual controller game object or the script alias game object.

This meant that ways to call certain methods was fragmented and lead
to confusing different options between methods.

The new ControllerReference script is used to get a reference to
a controller based on any number of things such as an index, the
actual GameObject, the script alias Object, the model Object or
even the controller hand.

Once a reference is retrieved, it can then access all of the elements
of a controller, such as:

 * index
 * actual
 * scriptAlias
 * model
 * hand

The ControllerReference script also has a collection of static methods
that are preferably used rather than needing to instantiate a new
object as the static methods do some nice checking to make sure
the ControllerReference is valid.

The Controller References are also cached for performance and
different instances of a Controller Reference object can be compared
as a custom comparator has been provided that compares on the index
of the controller which would always be universally unique.

A large collection of methods in the SDK implementations and SDK Bridge
have been re-written to utilise the Controller Reference, whilst a
collection of methods in the SDK Bridge have been deprecated and the
relevant methods in the SDK implementations have been removed.

All of the event payloads that passed a controller index around now
pass a controller reference, with the index being deprecated.

Added a basic test script to the Examples directory to test the
functionality of the Controller Reference script to ensure it is
all working as expected.",d564410ab1417aa8ef1e00390379e64e2240f249
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"fix(ControllerReference): prevent getting reference in OnEnable

Because SteamVR disables the controllers at start up, it means that if
the ControllerReference is attempted to be retrieved in an OnEnable
method, then the controller reference will be invalid therefore
causing issues with the rest of the script. The better solution is
to use a Getter that attempts to get the reference a fresh every
time it is requested, as the lower level calls are all cached then
this won't cause any slow down issues and will ensure the controller
is available.",9a98d0997b2880a9a9590a5fcab7316490ec8635
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"fix(Locomotion): correct teleport to destination point with dash

There was an issue with Dash Teleporting to a Destination Point
where the Destination Point would attempt to reseat the final
position to the Destination Point destination location but this
was happening too fast before the Dash Teleport had chance to
finish lerping to it's final destination.

The solution is to create a new way of overriding the final destination
of the teleport before the teleport event has triggered and then this
override is called from the destination point when the destination
marker events occur.

This now allows the destination point to only need one teleport event
as it tells the teleporter the actual destination rather than just
using the destination the pointer gave it.

The dash teleport also lerps the rotation of the teleport now as well
rather than just snapping to the new rotation which was incorrect.",5f4e36007bfe2837969037776d976ada61c03990
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"refactor(Interaction): apply best practice coding standards

The cases where an interactable object checks for a null value have
been updated to ensure they do an explicit check. Also the foreach
loops have been replaced with for loops as they are more efficient
in Unity 5.5 and below.

The Object Auto Grab script also now correctly cancels the
coroutine if the script is disabled.",c2c9e08d0f81a7a8909d70d6cc962d727eaaae33
VRTK-GearVR-Test,"refactor(Structure): replace occurrences of Equals with ==

Unity3d creates garbage when dealing with `Equals` as it's considered
a Boxing method and therefore is less efficient than simply comparing
with `==`

This information can be found at: goo.gl/apMyGU

This refactor replaces all of the occurrences of `Equals` with `==`
to provide the efficiency improvements.

The MoveInPlace script has also been slightly refactored to use a
`switch` statement rather than a collection of `if/else` statements
that all in turn used the `Equals` method as well.",bf90d21ff3726ad470eeb027d43b97d02af6d9fd

VRTK-GearVR-Test,"fix(Structure): ensure script references are correctly set

Previously, many of the script references required scripts to be placed
on the same GameObject as the existing script. Things like controller
related scripts should be able to be placed on child GameObjects on
the script alias objects.

Any generic play area script should not have to be on the same
GameObject as any other script so doing a `FindObjectOfType` is a
better way of finding the script. Even though this is slower it is
only done in `OnEnable` so shouldn't be that slow.

If it is slow then the ObjectCache can be used in the future.",07e6cc5de32acc032bc1e8ba6affb825d912f7d6

This is an oldie but goldie. There's an issue that arises only when building on the .NET backend with C# projects enabled (this is a deprecated scenario but still one that is really useful for fast iteration).

The problem is that even if an assembly is marked as a ""test assembly"" (as the play mode tests are), they will still be included in player builds for .NET-C# project builds. This is what the old comment was alluding to (but wasn't very specific about)

We also explored doing things like marking the play mode tests as editor only (i.e. matching what the edit mode test asmdef looks like) but this had the side effect of removing all tests from the test runner (bad, tests are gone). Also tried making things editor + Win32 (standalone) + Win64 (standalone) only as well, though this still had the same problem even when building UWP .NET

MixedRealityToolkit-Unity,"Turn off hand rays only when hand is near a grabbable object (#5823)

## Overview
If the hand is near the spatial mesh (SR), hand rays should not turn off. In fact, rays should only turn off if the hand is near a grabbable or touchable thing. This PR updates SpherePointer to return `IsNearObject` and `IsInteractionEnabled` only when the hand is near a collider that has a NearInteractionGrabbable on it. It also adds Grab Layer Masks, which allows developers to further prioritize and filter which objects a pointer can interact with. 

After this change, an object must both be on a Grabbable Layer as well as have a NearInteractionGrabbable component in order for hand rays to turn off. The Grabbable Layer is by default set to everything **except** Ignore Raycast and Spatial Awareness.

Fixes: #5748, #4203, #5621 

## Changes
- Add a Grabbable Layer Mask to Sphere Pointer to allow devs to easily disable all grabbable objects, and to improve performance
- The default Grabbale Layer Mask for the grab pointer is everything but Ignore Raycast and Spatial Awareness so that sphere casts don't check the spatial mesh (for perf).
- I also am caching the sphere query results to ensure we only do 3 sphere casts per frame (down from 11 without caching).
-  I snuck in a fix to pointer locking -- previously a pointer would lock when you clicked on any collidable, even if the collidable did not actually have any pointer handlers on it, or above it. now, the pointer will only lock if the pointer is actually grabbing an object that would handle pointer events. I may actually end up pulling that change into a separate PR.
- Add tests to verify my fix, and documentation reflecting the new grabbable behavior
- I also fixed the sphere pointer inspector -- it was actually not displaying several sphere pointer fields that it should have
- I removed the DebugSphere because it was not very useful, added a bit of extra code, and had bugs (did not turn off when debugsphere == false).

## Verification
- All playmode tests pass, new tests pass
- Verified that my new tests would have failed in old code
- Verified that my change actually fixes the bug (ray no longer hides when near SR)
- Runs on HoloLens 2 with no adverse perf impact.",b709083420f75723b9d0286583078b39ac506637

MixedRealityToolkit-Unity,"Update the MRTK runtime to not allocate a new list on each Update loop.

https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/5942

The core MRTK update loop was allocating a new List<> (actually, two, if you look at both Update and LateUpdate). This is because each call to MixedRealityServiceRegistry wasn't being cached. In addition, LINQ adds its own GC overhead (i.e. after re-creating the same identical list, the same list was then sorted again... and again... and again...)

This change avoids that by updating the GetAllServices call to return a cached list of services, which are sorted in priority order. That way the MRTK instead of having to re-copy and resort, can just use the same list on every single frame.

I had also considered keeping the original ""sort order"" (i.e. random, or actually, insertion order into the registry) but we never formally defined what the ordering of elements was here, and the prime and most important scenario here depends on it being priority order sorted, so we may as well optimize for that use case.

I didn't fully get rid of LINQ (note that the Reverse operation still uses LINQ) - this is okay because it's only in the shutdown path. Alternatively I could have changed the function signature of GetAllServices to be IReadOnlyList, but this would have been a breaking change for not a lot of value.",c5e6cca105fb695ee9870e41311d491b5ebceb8c

Zinnia.Unity,"feat(Tracking): allow chaining collision notifications

To allow interactors like a controller to interact with an unlimited
number of interactables performance has to be taken into
consideration. Instead of all interactables taking part of Unity's
physics notifications and checking whether the thing they collided
with is an interactor they want to work with, this change allows to
forward the collision events from the interactor to the interactable
it's colliding with. To give the receiving side of a forwarded event
all the needed information the sender of the forwarded collision
notification is added to the `EventData`. A check against the
forwarded collision's game object prevents an infinite loop when a
collision would otherwise get forwarded to itself forever.

Since the `CollisionTracker` always took part in the collision
notifications via Unity message methods this change also splits the
collision notification from the collision tracking by introducing a
new superclass that only provides events to get emitted on calling
its methods to do so. The existing tracker now subclasses this new
class and emits the respective event in response to Unity notifying
it about a collision.",19f2cb5ae21e187c70c911109e71f95bf683dccf

Zinnia.Unity,"perf(general): expect collections to be non-null implicitly

By ensuring that fields of collection type are initialized with a
non-null value by default the codebase can expect non-null values to
be used from there on. Instead of handling the rare case of the
field holding the collection to be set to null it will now throw

API need to use the copy API available on the `ArraySegment` type if
they intend to mutate the returned array (found inside the segment)
as it will be reused for other queries. The `SurfaceLocator` has
been changed to use a new sort method that is offered by a new type.

Zinnia.Unity,"fix(Collision): stop collisions when either side is disabled

There is an issue in Unity where when two objects are colliding will
create a collision started event, but whilst the objects are
intersecting, if one of the objects is disabled then Unity does not
consider this to stop the collision between the two objects so no
OnCollisionExit or OnTriggerExit occurs. However, if the disabled
object is re-enabled and is still in the same intersecting position
then Unity will consider this a new Enter event.

This causes a problem for the CollisionTracker as it means the state
of the tracker can become out of sync. If a collision starts twice
but no stop was called between, then the tracked collision state is
not valid. This would then have knock on effects in usages such as
the ActiveCollisionsContainer where a started collision is treated
as an active collision, but then if the object is disabled then
no stopped collision occurs and therefore that would still be
considered as an active collision.

To fix this issue and work around the shortcomings of Unity, a new
component is added at runtime to the GameObject that contains the
collider that is colliding with the CollisionTracker. This new
component then monitors the disabled state of the GameObject and upon
that GameObject becoming disabled will stop the collision manually
on the linked CollisionTracker. It will also then remove any traces
of the magically created component.

The CollisionTracker now also tracks any colliders it may be
intersecting with and therefore if the CollisionTracker is disabled
then any collider it may be linked to also has the Collision Stopped
event emitted for to ensure both sides of the collision adhere to the
disabled state.

This new functionality is optional and can be turned off by the `Stop
Collisions On Disable` property, which can only be set at edit time to
prevent fundamental state getting out of sync if it was changed at
runtime.

The `AddComponent` and `Destroy` are used over a pooling method because
these only occur on the `Enter/Exit` events so are not firing all the
time and therefore performance hits should be reduced. But also,
pooling would create a large set of GameObjects for each
CollisionTracker and they would all have to independently manage these
pools themselves resulting in a potential large number of pooled
GameObjects being created on scene start, which would have a potential
much larger impact on initial performance.

The tests have been updated to showcase the issue of disabling a
GameObject on either side of the collision now can successfully result
in the Stopped event being emitted.",102aa52870d40345102a05274335b547c37c38a7
Zinnia.Unity,"fix(Collisions): only track active containing transform collisions

The ActiveCollisionsContainer was tracking every collision between
nested colliders due to changes in how the CollisionNotifier worked
but this caused issues as the active collisions should only be based
on the overall containing colliding Transform otherwise unwanted
artifacts are produced such as untouch events when moving between
colliders even though the object is still fundamentally being touched.

This then had a compound affect on publishing to all of the nested
colliders which would cause performance issues.

The fix is to track each individual collision that is received from
the CollisionNotifier but to keep a dictionary of which collisions are
associated to the overall containing Transform. This way the
ActiveCollisionsContainer logic and events can be limited to only
happen when a completely new collision on another containing Transform.

This brings the functionality back in line with how it worked before
the CollisionNotifier changes, whilst honouring the changes to the
ability to allow a Collider to be disabled and to tell the
CollisionTracker that the collision has ended.",9d32c9e7ea55372e6ff85d1a5fc04c497796503b

VRTK,"feat(ControllerReference): add new way of referencing controllers

Previously, controller calls were referenced in a number of ways from
utilising the controller's id, to passing a game object of either the
actual controller game object or the script alias game object.

This meant that ways to call certain methods was fragmented and lead
to confusing different options between methods.

The new ControllerReference script is used to get a reference to
a controller based on any number of things such as an index, the
actual GameObject, the script alias Object, the model Object or
even the controller hand.

Once a reference is retrieved, it can then access all of the elements
of a controller, such as:

 * index
 * actual
 * scriptAlias
 * model
 * hand

The ControllerReference script also has a collection of static methods
that are preferably used rather than needing to instantiate a new
object as the static methods do some nice checking to make sure
the ControllerReference is valid.

The Controller References are also cached for performance and
different instances of a Controller Reference object can be compared
as a custom comparator has been provided that compares on the index
of the controller which would always be universally unique.

A large collection of methods in the SDK implementations and SDK Bridge
have been re-written to utilise the Controller Reference, whilst a
collection of methods in the SDK Bridge have been deprecated and the
relevant methods in the SDK implementations have been removed.

All of the event payloads that passed a controller index around now
pass a controller reference, with the index being deprecated.

Added a basic test script to the Examples directory to test the

Because SteamVR disables the controllers at start up, it means that if

to use a Getter that attempts to get the reference a fresh every
time it is requested, as the lower level calls are all cached then

There was an issue with Dash Teleporting to a Destination Point
where the Destination Point would attempt to reseat the final
position to the Destination Point destination location but this

finish lerping to it's final destination.

The solution is to create a new way of overriding the final destination
of the teleport before the teleport event has triggered and then this
override is called from the destination point when the destination
marker events occur.

This now allows the destination point to only need one teleport event
as it tells the teleporter the actual destination rather than just
using the destination the pointer gave it.

The dash teleport also lerps the rotation of the teleport now as well

This change adds support for video profile selection on UWP, as well as resolution and/or framerate constraints for video capture. It enables selecting lower capture resolutions and/or framerates on devices where the default video capture format impacts performances, like HoloLens 2.

This builds upon the upstream change webrtc-uwp/webrtc-apis#24 adding support for video profiles in the UWP layer of the core WebRTC implementation.

On the Unity side, the `LocalVideoSource` component has been modified to introduce a new `LocalVideoSourceFormatMode` parameter which, when set to its default value of `Automatic`, will force selecting a resolution of around 1000 pixels in width on HoloLens 1 and HoloLens 2 to save on battery and CPU usage and increase performance.

MixedReality-WebRTC,"Update the Unity library to handle split sources (#404)

Convert `WebcamSource` and `MicrophoneSource` to source objects shareable among

Because the `SceneVideoSender` component uses the ARGB32 callback, also re-add
that callback, and add a TODO to remove all ARGB32 callbacks in favor of
explicit conversion utility functions, for clarity about the performance
implication of the conversion.

This change also splits the `VideoChatDemo` and `SceneCaptureDemo` for clarity,
leaving each demo with a single audio and video track per peer connection.  The
`SceneCaptureDemo` now has a placeholder showing the capture camera position.
Multiple tracks per peer connection are demo-ed in the `StandaloneDemo`.

UniVRM,"Allow first/third person layers to be named

The first person and third person layers used hard coded IDs. If these layers
are already in use in a Unity project, this use can lead to conflicts between
the layers used by UniVRM and those inside the project. This patch allows using
Unity's layer settings to assign layer IDs through names (""VRMFirstPersonOnly""
and ""VRMThirdPersonOnly"").

If no named layers are found, the predefined layer IDs will be used. Since the
layer IDs are accessed only during model setup, there should be no performance
impact from this change. The names of the fields storing the layer IDs have not
been changed to keep API compatibility.

headset maps directly to its actual position, greatly enhancing
accuracy of movement and manipulation.
* Tracking now primarily utilizes the onboard IMU, easily handling
movements both quick and slow with low latency and a precise feel.
Optical tracking works in tandem with the IMU to provide absolute
reference. The system handles Oculus’ unsolicited recenters with ease.

unnoticeable with short drops

HolojamSDK-Unity,"Complete server rewrite, initial FlatBuffers integration

Removed deprecated protocol and Protobuf plugin
Integrated Google FlatBuffers into the Unity SDK (C#) with the Holojam
protocol v0.1.0 (first pass)

Rewrote Client and Network.Utility
- Unity loop refactored and minimalized, maintaining two lists of
views: staged and untracked
- Base abstract Exchange class used for new Emitter and Sink classes
Emitter packages and sends data out asynchronously (at a fixed rate) as
updates, no longer running on a dedicated thread
Sink retains some of the original thread model, but smaller and with
less processing
- Timers and associated processing removed completely, replaced by a
stack of updates used concurrently
No longer dedicated dictionaries or swap objects
Each update (from Network.Utility) manages a raw protocol packet and a
lightweight lookup table for fast access, utilizing FlatBuffers’
random-access feature
The Unity thread passes untracked views to the sink, which then clears
the stack (refreshing the views with the latest updates)
- Network.Utility includes the Translator class for building FlatBuffer
packets
- Additional minor patches, performance improvements
- Client inspector simplified somewhat

importantly—enforces consistency and reduces bandwidth + CPU

- Emitter thread uses a high-res timer to synchronize outgoing packets,
given a render loop that’s fast enough

Staging moved out of Update into new Refresh method
